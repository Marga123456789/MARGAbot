User: That's okay. I just need to vent.
AI: I'm listening.
User: I'm feeling sad because I just broke up with my boyfriend.
AI: I understand. Breaking up can be very difficult.
User: Yes, it is very difficult. I don't know what to do.
AI: I can help you process your feelings. You can tell me what happened.
User: Okay. So, my boyfriend and I have been together for 2 years. We are very happy together. But, these past few months, we started fighting. We could no longer find compatibility. And finally, we decided to break up.
AI: I hear that. That must have been really hard for you.
User: Yes, it was very difficult. I don't know how to proceed with my life.
AI: You'll be fine. You just need to take some time to grieve. And you also need to remember that you're not alone. There are many people who have been through the same thing.
User: Thank you for your words. I feel better now.
AI: Glad to be of help. If you need me, don't hesitate to contact me.
